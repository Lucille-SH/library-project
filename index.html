        The history of libraries began with the first efforts to organize
        collections of documents. The first libraries consisted of archives of
        the earliest form of writingâ€”the clay tablets in cuneiform script
        discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. <br /><br />Private or
        personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece
        in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the
        Classical period, the great librart of the Mediterranean world remained
        those of Constantinople and Alexandria.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, libraries may provide physical or digital access to material, and
        may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both.
        <br /><br />
        A libraries collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers,
        manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes,
        videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, table
        games, video games and other formats. <br /><br />Libraries range widely
        in size, up to millions of items. <br /><br />
        Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often
        offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration.
